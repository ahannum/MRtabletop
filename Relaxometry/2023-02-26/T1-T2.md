# Relaxometry measurements taken February 26, 2023

Expected values are based on 1.5 T measurements reported in a 2022 study [^1].
Expected T2 values are copied directly from this paper.
Expected T1 values are estimated using the $B_0^{1/3}$ [rule of thumb](https://mriquestions.com/bo-effect-on-t1--t2.html). The nominal field of the tabletop system is 0.26T.

All measured time constants were computed by the Relax 2.0 software via linear fit to the log of the decay/recovery curve.
All values in milliseconds.
