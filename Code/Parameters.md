# System Parameters

Each System has its own unique center frequency and shim parameters. These may change based on temperature and location but the following parameters have
been shown to obtain decent signal and images:

| Tabletop    | Center Frequency | Shim X | Shim Y | Shim Z  | Shim Z2 |
| ----------- | -----------      | -------| -------| ------- | -------|
| Ocra1       |                  | -51    | 76     | 156     | 9      |
| Ocra2       | 11.231050        | -51    | 76     | 156     | 9      |
