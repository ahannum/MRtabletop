# Phantom Development 

## Field of View

Phantoms designers must be aware of the limited intrinsic FOV of the RF coil. This FOV spans 20mm along the axis of the bore. The FOV center is 15mm from the bottom of the bore.

## Containers

Test tubes are used to install samples into the bore cavity. These tubes have a 10mm outer diameter and a flat bottom. Approximately 1 mL of liquid fills to the FOV center. Use a graduated pipette to fill the tube cleanly and precisely.

Lids exist in the form of cork stoppers and yellow plastic caps.

## Inventory Management

Label maker is currently MIA. Nevertheless, label your phantom or risk it being discarded / repurposed.

## Agar Preparation

Combine boiling water and agar powder in 1% concentration (by weight) and stir. Add to test tube immediately.

Tip: immerse the tube and pipette in hot water beforehand to minimize premature setting during the fill process.

Tip: Chill in fridge for at least 10 min for a good set before adding any other material to the phantom.
